# Blind-Data-Exfil-Server-Side-javascript-injection

A Python script that automates blind NoSQL injection to extract usernames from vulnerable web applications. The script exploits Server-Side JavaScript Injection (SSJI) via the $where clause in MongoDB queries.

ðŸš€ Features
Automated username extraction using character-by-character brute force.
Uses NoSQL injection (this.username.match()) to determine valid username characters.
Supports a-z, A-Z, 0-9 (modifiable charset).
Mimics real browser headers for stealth.
Response-based detection (checks for successful login indicators).
Includes debugging output (payload, response length, status code).

## Usage
`python3 extract_username.py`

## Configuration
Modify these values before running the script:

URL â†’ Set to the vulnerable website.
HEADERS â†’ Update headers if needed for better stealth.
CHARSET â†’ Modify character set if usernames contain special characters.
username â†’ Change the starting prefix (HTB{) if applicable.


## How It Works
Sends a NoSQL injection payload:
```
" || (this.username.match("^HTB{X.*")) || ""=="  
```

If "X" is correct, the server responds with "Logged in as" or "Nothing to see here".
If "X" is incorrect, it moves to the next character.
Loops through a-z, A-Z, 0-9 until it reconstructs the full username.

Stops when the complete username is found.
